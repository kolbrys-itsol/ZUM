@noclador It has been reported the drones last on average 3 trips. That means they need 29000 drones a week. Most of those drone operators will probably not be dropping grenades. They will probably be used for fire correction etc.

"@Fireblade577 @maihem14 @Porkshop09 @henriksen78 @tomek_jezierski He was out of ammo, so pointing the gun would possibly not have mattered much."
@Partizaan5 @maihem14 @Fireblade577 The tank is probably in pretty shitty condition. They usually have to chose between sending the tank away from the front to be repaired or keeping the tank there. They wont get any replacements while sending it away.
"@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 Yeah, and you did the same thing as he did. https://t.co/d0gdW03Lx3"
"@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 I'm not the one who is asking for credentials here buddy. I'm speaking from my point of view, but you are expressing the view of others and ask for military experience when having a different point of view than yours."

@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 Did you ask for credentials? https://t.co/u5LTOro9Mp
"@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 You complain about them nearly getting stuck, but still you want them to twist the tank digging it in even further. Your argument does not make sense. The ground there is quite soft."
@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 Depends on who you ask. You live in a perfect scenario world. These guys live in a world where they have to adapt to the reality on the ground. Where they have limited ammo and personnel.
@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 I disagree.
@0p3rat0r2 It wont make me have seen more of that in this war.
@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 This is true for well built trenches which have been fortified for months/years. But it did the trick here.
"@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 That would require them to go in before the tanks. Which would have put them at risk. Just give up, you are grasping at straws. It's not a textbook assault, but they did have infantry and suppressive fire from IFV while approaching."
"@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 What if they saw them walk in on foot with their high quality drone? I asked you before and ill ask you again, how would infantry on the ground have change the equation here?"
"@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 You can yell bad tactics all you want, but they captured the trench with minimal risk to UA lives."
@Fireblade577 @GreenMercy_ @Starlitz2 You have ho idea what information they had. They had suppressive fire while moving up plus drone coverage. Once they reached the trench the enemy was suppressed and hiding in the trench.
"@rcvisee74 So: ""The enemy looks like he is having a bad day, lets back off ang give him some privacy"" Is that what you are suggesting?"
@rcvisee74 How did you come up with that conclusion?
@Timothy48120197 🤣
@Fireblade577 How would risking more units there have helped? I think it's very easy to look at the schoolbook and criticize. What would the infantry support have protected the tank from here?

2/2 My take on this is that the tanks are like a QRF responding to either RU taking the trench from UA and are trying to aid potential UA soldiers still in the area trying to get out. Or they are responding to RU moving in on an empty trench.
1/2 A lot of people are commenting on there being no UA infantry and this not being a perfect CAA operation.
It's not clear if the russians just took the position from UA or if they manned an empty trench.

It's very likely RuAF will continue to reinforce their success in Avdiivka and it might even be a good excuse for not taking Bakhmut. Remember these words:
Bakhmut was just a feint
"According to RUMINT, UA lost SAM capabilities in the Avdiivka area and it has allowed the Russians to use attack aircraft on medium to high altitude in the area, out of range for MANPADS. This might explain why RuAF have had success."

"Hopefully UA have a long term plan for Bakhmut and have done the math on the subject.  It's possible they see it as a Kursk scenario, and if they have a plan for an upcoming offensive, the math might tell them it's worth it."
"It's pretty simple, when you are being shot at from 3 directions and the enemy are shooting at your GLOC, you are not in a good position. This is still true even if the RU advance have stopped. This is why I've been saying it might be time to leave Bakhmut."
"I still believe the UA position in Bakhmut is favorable. The attrition ratio is not nearly as favorable as it was in December, I'm hearing numbers much lower than those which circulate in western media. However, I believe the ratio have turned slightly in UA favor the last weeks."
The two most likely scenarios for Bakhmut at this point is:
1. The RU offensive comes to a halt due to attrition and Bakhmut becomes the new Marinka.
2. RuAF rotate forces and manage to do one last push forcing the AFU to withdraw.

@VictorishB123 I think they are using some of what they saved for an offensive. Just like they used some units dedicated for a spring offensive.
Some time during the summer is also when most experts believe RuAF will start running in to some real issues with ammunition.
"I think we will see another month or so with RuAF having the upper hand. Possibly a bit slower May. But some time during June, I think we might see the AFU starting to operate more offensively."
"I have expressed disagreement with the defense of Bakhmut. This is not because I think UA are doing the wrong thing over all, but rather I think they need to sacrifice more land for time and RU bodies rather than sacrificing UA soldiers."
"What I believe we are seeing right now is kind of what we saw during the summer. UA are trying to reconstitute offensive potential while defending with ""minimal"" resources. That being said, those minimal resources are much greater now than during the summer."
"RuAF have gradually stepped up their efforts to attack Bakhmut since the fall Yakovlivka, and after the fall of Soledar they really stepped it up in late January."
"After Yakovlivka was captured RuAF had the upper hand, the AFU had exhausted a lot of their combat potential during the fall offensive."
RuAF managed to capture Yakovlivka in early December after committing more resources to the area (VDV). At this point RuAF gradually started introducing more and more of the personnel which was mobilized in October.
https://t.co/IPwG0kwJM9
RuAF have during and after the withdrawal from Kherson successfully trained their mobiks for around 3 months. integrated them in to their regular units (and created new ones). They have moved a lot of the assault units from Kherson to Bakhmut and Kreminna.
"At this point in time, I'm leaning towards RU made a rational decision to withdraw over time from Kherson (they did so quite successfully) to continue their offensive during the winter and possibly gain the upper hand. I think this was a wise and important decision by RU."
"I also think they realized they would not be able to do any kind of offensives west of the Dnipro and deemed it too costly to try to keep it. They could instead withdraw their units, reconstitute their combat potential and use them elsewhere."
"But even after a UA breakthrough of RU lines, RuAF managed to stop the AFU by sending reinforcements after just a few days. "
At this point RuAF successfully restored GLOC over the NK dam with temporary bridges and I thin they could have stayed in Kherson the year out.
"During this time AFU attempted ground assaults in both the south and north part of Kherson region, with mixed results. Mostly unsuccessful. They did have some success in the northern part which proved to be the most difficult to supply for RuAF."
"Once that was done, AFU stepped up their effort to attack RuAF GLOC in the Kherson region, especially bridges and barges. While having some initial success surprising  RU logistics, RuAF quickly adapted using barges from different launch locations."
"Late summer, early fall, Ukraine managed to recaptured large parts of Kharkiv region as a result of attrition and low morale and a severe personnel shortage RuAF were unable to defend Kharkiv region."
Some time during the summer is also when most experts believe RuAF will start running in to some real issues with ammunition.
"During that time Ukraine accumulated equipment and trained troops, while starting strike RU logistic targets with HIMARS. At the same time, RuAF decided to move almost all their VDV units, plus Eastern and Central Military district away from Kharkiv region."
"Ukraine spend the summer training and building offensive potential in their units while defending all along the frontline with minimal resources, There were multiple reports from the frontlines about them not having enough resources"
"RuAF have been on the offensive for more than 1.5 month now and offensive operations like that does wear on both equipment, personnel and local ammunition stocks. I do not see them continuing this pace of attacks for more than another month or so. Many unknown variables."
"RuAF are slowly advancing in both Bakhmut and Avdiivka. There has been a few reports about RuAF not having any reserves behind the lines, but I'm not sure I believe them."

@D_r_A_p_E_r_13 @MasterChiefIRL1 It's not really about territory. It's about force depletion. At the moment I don't think it's looking favorable for Ukraine. I also get a feeling the over all confidence in the higher command among soldiers on the ground is getting lower.

This article tells a different story. A story about how mobilized are sent to the front after 5 days of training.
https://t.co/3zRLC5Fqev
The counter attack is supposed being conducted by additionally committed resources possibly intended for offensive operation. If this is the case they are wasting future offensive potential on a lost cause.
"I hope I'm wrong about  Syrskyi, but he has made some strange calls."
There are rumors about Syrskyi ordering a counter attack south of Bakhmut. I hope this is psyops and that they are in fact retreating instead.
"I would like to add that I think it's been time for UA to withdraw from Bakhmut for some time now. At the moment they are wasting personnel in an unfavorable position. I think General Syrskyi is doing what the Soviets always did, throw more bodies at the problem."

Magyar also states fighting around Bakhmut have been relatively slow during the day. The fighting was more active during the night due to AFU nighttime operations. Whoever have the equipment and training to operate at night have a huge advantage.

A withdrawal west of the Bakhmutovka River is something I have mentioned previously as an indicator of preparations for a withdrawal from the city. I do however not think there is an immediate need for the AFU to leave the city. It's not too late to defend Bakhmut.

https://t.co/2m5ML8wDRq
"Considering all recent reports, it seems the AFU are pushing back a bit around Bakhmut. Previously we have seen the AFU reset months of RU progress in a few days. Will be interesting to see if something similar will happen now (not months this time since RU have advanced faster)"
UA telegram channel report about AFU counter attack south of Bakhmut and Krasna Hora still not being captured.
"They also posted an image with the text ""Under control"""
https://t.co/VGC0w86qUU https://t.co/U1KLHkBT7j
Bakhmut
"The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Fedorivka, Paraskoviivka and Bakhmut. Attacks are mainly done by a mix of VDV and PMC Wagner. It seems to me like the RuAF attacks get weaker and weaker. It could be AFU getting stronger and stronger too. https://t.co/qRchQpdwaU"
Sivers'k
South of the river the AFU repulsed an attack in the area of Bilohorivka (still controlled by the AFU)
2nd Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade and/or Akhmats might have advances around 1k in the Berestove area. https://t.co/HTiT6Us0ta

Kreminna
"The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of  Nevs'ke, Kreminna, Kuzmine and Shypylivka. RuAF use a large mix of VDV, 3rd MRD, 144th GMRD 2nd AK, BARS units supported by 1st Mobile CBRN brigade from Central MD to attack in this area. These units have been refilled with mobiks https://t.co/9M8hdiEQRO"
There are reports about some units from 2nd Guards Taman Motor Rifle Division arriving in this area on the Russian side of the border. They have been in Belarus for a few months restoring combat capability. It's likely we will see increased activity by RuAF in this area.
Kupyansk
The AFU repulsed an attack in the area of Hryanykivka. Continued attempts by 138th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade to force the AFU to the west side of the Oskil river. https://t.co/YG3YDIG2PW
Weather by @davidhelms570
It's getting warmer in the south and the snow is probably melting.  This could have a negative affect on the RU attempts to advance in the Vuhledar direction.

Kreminna-Siversk
The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Kreminna and Bilohorivka. Continued efforts by RU to improve their positions for an offensive towards Lyman and Sivers'k. https://t.co/so5FC72XxU
Keeping the AFU bridge head in artillery range is essential for RuAF to prevent the AFU from developing an offensive in this area.
The AFU repulsed an attack by the 138th Separate Motorized rifle Brigade in the area of Hryanykivka. RuAF are trying to push the AFU out of the salient along the Oskil river north of Kupyansk. https://t.co/8ZRd8qUqVq

Shutting down coms to and evacuating civilians would allow AFU to retreat without info being relayed to the Russians.
https://t.co/N1nsOIsyGl
"I think there is another reason. I think they are about to shut down communications in preparation for a withdraw. It could also be a counter attack, but I would not bet on it."
"Multiple Ukrainian sources talk about a RU sabotage group caught in Bakhmut. According the reports, Bakhmut will be closed of to Civilians, reporters and aid workers from tomorrow."
South of Bakhmut RuAF are attacking towards Chasiv Yar in an attempt to cut of the T-0504 road but I do not think they are successful yet.
"RuAF are slowly getting closer to the M03 road. The Road it self is not important at this point, but it is located on high ground which. It might be problematic for the FU if RuAF manage to consolidate positions on the high ground. https://t.co/xZlbpTF3EV"
Bakhmut
"The AFU repulsed attacks in the area ofFedorivka, Bakhmut, Ivanivske and Chasiv Yar. A mix of RU regular forces and Wagner are attacking towards the M03 north of Bakhmut. https://t.co/cTFEbuhB96"
It will be interesting to see if RuAF can expand their offensive towards Tors'ke to the north and south.
Kreminna-Siversk
"The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Tors'ke, Serebryansʹkyy forest and Bilohorivka. According to geolocated videos and Ukrainian reports, RuAF have advanced close to Tors'ke, the RU advance will most likely not reach much further west. https://t.co/mi6qGWeCTA"
"It seems RuAF are advancing with some success in 3 areas Kupyansk, Kreminna, Bakhmut. They are also attacking Vuhledar without success and with huge losses. https://t.co/OG9lVT0SuK"
It's quite clear that a large chunk of the mobiks which have been training since the October mobilization has been engaged in assaults in several areas.

@J_JHelin I just don't see ukraine benefitting from this. That is why I suspect Russian attack
"@J_JHelin I think it's the Russians, they seem to have been targeting it. https://t.co/KzJJlGgUYj"
@J_JHelin @GeoConfirmed That explains why the russians have shelled that area.
"@Mossquiet @peter58587 I don't think that's the case, actually. My opinion shifted."
"@cthulhu985 If ""it"" could provide targeting to something on an airframe. Well."
"@peter58587 I have, indirectly"
"@cthulhu985 Absolutely. That said, VKS pilots have proven unwilling to fly (Most of the time) in actually contested airspace for the last 11-12mo, and it is impossible to think that being hit directly over Klintsy won't again change their calculations."
"Possible this was a Russian strike force dropping multiple UPMK glide kit-fitted bombs (JDAM lite), which're the latest proZ wunderwaffe, been used extensively."
"If so, this ambush made the viability of such strikes much more doubtful. Key point that I haven't seen mentioned yet. https://t.co/eecYyfoNzd"

So much analysis of this misses the personal factor.
Why wouldn't you target the people who wanted to turn you into a literal footnote of history?
@Redsoo_74 speak english pls
Sensible people in European security circles should be thinking about how to manage and mitigate a service absolutely willing to go kinetic on their soil in five or ten years when some of the Russian men who were Bucha or Mariupol manage to get to Germany etc
"Something I didn't say in November that I think now- this stuff has a deeply personal tinge.  The Ukrainians are targeting people because they see them as guilty of assisting in their (attempted) genocide. This is Mossad in the 60s, and they are only just starting. https://t.co/GACtjIAzWf"

"@walter_report No, Wagner isn't the Russian Army. There is a clear distinction in command structure and operational goals. "
The Russian army also has institutionalised criminal activity- but it is not the same organisation.

@JimmySecUK And focusing on individual system capabilities is a mistake.
"@JimmySecUK It's really not, and you're constantly misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make, and focusing on individual system capabilities and not on how the Russians (or anyone else) should be using their systems and why a 2S6M1 is sitting on a street with no supporting assets"
"@JimmySecUK @David_Jorgonson If Russian forces were employing the systems they should have in stock, it wouldn't need to engage (and indeed shouldn't) small consumer drones with a Tunguska"
@dux_natangiae @JimmySecUK That the Russian AD net wasn't functioning for weeks isn't to do with the Pantsir system itself. It's how the systems were (not) employed
"@David_Jorgonson @JimmySecUK ""Hey, this system (which isn't turned on) can't even detect (a target it wasn't designed for)"" isn't really a legitimate demonstration of the effectiveness of said system at what it is supposed to do, and Russian SAM systems are generally extremely effective when used correctly."
"@JimmySecUK I disagree. If Russian EW assets were working as would be ideal, that drone wouldn't even be there. The operators would have eaten a Krasnopol regardless also."
It's about supporting assets and their role. No Tunguska equivalent system should be wasting missiles on a DJI
@JimmySecUK Yeah but that's like saying any modern tank is horribly vulnerable to top attack ATGM or drone dropped PG-7M.
Use it in the right way and with the right supporting forces and you mitigate that risk. It's about how the systems are operated
@Xtian375 @JimmySecUK I don't think it's remarkably vulnerable
@JimmySecUK ...sure. Not that the Ukrainians are just yeeting HARMs in that locale.

"@JimmySecUK It's like saying this 2009 Defender 90 can't even catch up with my Ferrari, yeah, because it's designed for different tasks"

"The search radar also wouldn't be expected to be set up to target a consumer drone directly above the vehicle. The Tunguska is effective, it's just not designed for this (and isn't searching for targets)"

Motorcycles are the primary mode of transportation, particularly in rural towns like Moura, where other transportation is scarce or absent. Photo: Tom Peyre-Costa/NRC https://t.co/2Z0VGqOTdf"
"7/ During raids, the Wagner and Mali forces implemented a strategy of burning motorcycles indiscriminately, guided by the notion that if nobody possesses them, the islamists would also lose their transportation means."
"6/ In the past, it was not uncommon for Mali authorities to impose bans on motorcycles in areas where radical Islamists operated. The motorcycle bans aimed to limit the mobility of jihadists, preventing them from easily ambushing government forces and escaping."
"5/ The Mali forces and Wagner mercenaries, as previously stated, not only perpetrated atrocities and mass murders against the local population but also intentionally burned their motorcycles. So why did they burn motorcycles, and what is important?"

@david1lz It's absolutely realistic based on my current understanding. Wagner is really tailored for assaults. They don't have time or resources to prepare defenses and train commanders for defensive operation. It's absolutely possible to force them to retreat and take back Bakhmut quickly
"@SpiritWar7 I am not sure about it, because cutting off Debaltseve - main supply route between Luhansk-Horlivka-Debalteseve might be a better option."
@CornixCorone @loogunda Not exactly.
"@JamesGu92720828 Correct. They do have a ""core"". Most of them right now in Africa, where Wagner generates cash for Prigozhyn - I recommend you to read my previous thread about their activities in Africa. As for Ukraine, they seem to engage less in assaults to avoid ""costly"" losses."

@loogunda Why not? Debaltseve and Illovaysk are absolutely within reach
@CavaCavanhas I don't merely analyze his words. His words just provide additional context and support already known information.
"12/ While this is mere speculation on my part, considering the poor state of their troops in Bakhmut, launching a counter-offensive in this direction could cause a serious blow to russian morale. This is just one of many potential directions for such an attack."
"11/ While it's unclear if our command will decide to counter-attack in the area, it's quite possible that what russia was able to achieve in the course of 9 months will be reversed within a week and result in a breakthrough and encirclement of Horlivka and the rears of Donetsk."
"10/ Wagner troops lack both training and experience in preparing complex and organized defenses. Organizing defenses, establishing firing positions, and managing logistics in a well-structured manner is difficult, and Wagner is not designed or equipped for it."
"9/ Without artillery superiority on the field, Wagner's tactics don't work and yield no results and lead to fruitless and unsustainable casualty ratios. We need much more ammo, artillery and other counter-battery means to nullify their assault capabilities."
"8/ However, Prigozhin himself admitted that without artillery ammo, Wagner is ineffective, and they can only move forward with huge losses that they cannot sustain. The MoD seems reluctant to provide more support, likely due to their fear of a counter-attack at any moment."
"7/ In Bakhmut, Wagner manages to move forward by turning defensive positions into rubble with intense artillery, mortar, TOS, and air support fire. They are also aware of the Ukrainian forces' lack of artillery ammunition and are not afraid of counter-battery fire."
"6/ Example: A newly formed ""Wolves"" squad drove to Ukrainian lines without coordination, attempting to ""gain reputation"". However, due to their lack of knowledge about the area and the situation, they drove into a landmine and died. The wounded members had to be evacuated."
"5/ The emergence of multiple ""PMCs"": Wagner, Potok, Veteran, Yenisey, Skif, Tigr, Irbis, Rys' and Wolves have created additional coordination complexities, including logistical challenges, a lack of clear command chains, and insufficient intelligence exchange and coordination."
"4/ Poor cooperation between Wagner and MoD results in a lack of coordination between them. The MoD only establishes control over territories captured by Wagner, while Wagner continues to assault forward without proper coordination."
"3/ Serious tensions exist between Wagner and the Ministry of Defense. These tensions exist not only at the top level but also at the regular level. Some Wagner units act as policing forces, commit crimes, and openly disrespect military commanders with impunity."
"2/ Wagner convicts have limited value and only make advances when heavy artillery fire is present. If the artillery is suppressed or runs out of ammunition, they don't make progress. Unfortunately, the lack of ammunition on our side hinders counter-battery fire."
"🧵Given the recent speech by Prigozhin, it is important to clarify the situation in Bakhmut. Based on compiled information that I am allowed to publish, it is true that Wagner is responsible for assaults and advances in Bakhmut. So why do things look grim on their end? https://t.co/BtbwxvyKx8"

"11/ The presence of TB-2 drones near Wagner bases in Mali, as well as their appearance on an airfield apron typically used by the group, raise serious concerns. Scrutinizing these incidents is crucial to prevent russia from using drones or obtaining sensitive information"
"10/ In March, a Bayraktar recently transferred from Turkey to Mali was observed on an apron typically used by the Wagner Group.

"5/ It should be noted that a third car with explosives was also planned for use during the attack, but it was ultimately destroyed by the Malian army using a Bayraktar TB2 attack UAV. This key detail will be significant as we return to the topic of Bayraktar later on."

"@kalorienpabst @PatriciaAlexann Yes, the process is slowly moving. Partially because people talk about it publicly. Shouldn’t be that way, but this is the way"
@CasualArtyFan A) Your numbers are very off.
"B) No, we don’t have those numbers, but we do have ability to invite consultants and advisors"
"C) We do not have a program that teaches senior officers abroad, and we are one year into this war. "
D) We have similar to division structure already
"@pi_pony I am Ukrainian, stop this nonsense. I am not here to support a favorite team as a fanboy, I see how issues lead to deaths of people."
@PatriciaAlexann Because other places don’t work.
@CasualArtyFan Crossing the road on a green light has risks as well. Chemotherapy is a risk. There is such a thing as justified risk. Not taking actions is a greater risk
"19/ In my forthcoming conclusion thread, I intend to provide a summary of the pressing concerns that require attention. In my view, merely seeking assistance from our allies is insufficient; it is imperative that we undertake internal changes to preserve the lives of our soldiers"
"18/ and their assigned officers are typically temporary. In comparison, division or an army has a clearly defined structure that operates as a single mechanism with clearly defined duties and responsibilities."
"17/ as it does not have standing armies or divisions. However, there exist de facto ""territorial"" organizational units that coordinate the actions of multiple brigades. While these units may function like divisions in some ways, they lack a proper division structure"
"16/ In addition to the insightful observations made by Glen Grant, I would like to contribute my own observations regarding the current state of Ukraine's military organization.  It is important to note that Ukraine's highest organizational unit is the brigade,"
"15/ reach-back ability for technical equipment for replacement and repair such as phones, computers, and radios, and forward maintenance of all soft-skin and armored vehicles up to engine and barrel changes, and minor body repair,"
"14/ including medical supply and evacuation, unit combat supplies such as food, fuel, ammunition, batteries, vehicle spares, and drones, personal equipment of all types through digital registration"
"13/ In instances where extreme distances are involved, the logistics ""socket"" should be extended to bring the required supplies closer to the unit. The logistics power socket should encompass the essential elements of combat supply"
"12/ In order to ensure a streamlined logistics process, each area must have a dedicated logistics hub, that ensures that no brigade has to reach back more than one hour's drive to obtain what they require."
11/ It is crucial to have an officer in each unit who is not in the battle space and can assist with necessary documentation for families when a partner dies or is critically injured.
"10/ The military medical system has major weaknesses. Uncoordinated training for soldiers in battlefield medicine, and poor policies at the national level for supporting and funding the seriously injured or those needing basic medical drugs."
9/ The reliance on Ukroboronprom to produce defence weapons has resulted in a monopolistic system that is not perfectly suitable for war. It has proven to be slow in delivering the necessary weapons and equipment.
"8/ The lack of standardization across the Ukrainian army is a significant problem that hinders successful operations. The mix of the Soviet system, NATO standards, and improvisation has led to chaos. It is essential to establish a unified system."
7/ Staff appointments such as Chief J7 (Training) should not make command decisions about training requirements. Commanders should only be appointed to command operations or to command the creation and training of units for operations.
"6/ In larger NATO countries, collective training is regularly conducted at battalion and brigade levels and even at the division level during major exercises. Lessons learned from the front line should be passed on to every soldier and instructor to improve their training."
5/ A fundamental area that requires urgent action is collective training. It is crucial for units to receive collective training to improve their skills and ensure that they can work effectively as a team.
4/ It is imperative to establish a policy that streamlines the identification process of potential commanders for promotion and simultaneously identifies those who are unsuitable for command.
"3/ In some cases, commanders have been selected through nepotism or connections rather than their performance and results. This is a concerning issue that needs to be addressed immediately to ensure that the most qualified individuals are appointed to leadership positions."
"2/ Glen suggests that a priority policy should be implemented to replace all military personnel who are not performing frontline tasks with civilians who have comparable or better related skills. Additionally, the use of TrO volunteers should be considered."
Thread🧵
"1/ It is my belief that NATO and the US have not fully committed to stop russia in Ukraine. However, there are areas within our own military that require attention. As discussed in Part I, I will reference an article by Glen Grant to discuss these issues https://t.co/L65qr6SU6D"

"5/ The enemy sometimes drops two or three of these to maximize effect. Additional danger lies in the fact that the type of gas being released is not always clear and can be difficult to identify, particularly when it is released from unmarked containers."

"@dryfly_whodat @ua_ydudar They still have superior numbers of artillery and available ammo. Even with announced help, it will take time for Ukraine to catch up.

"@antiwatnic No, the war end is not starting. It’s a decisive point which will determine the further course of war, but it doesn’t end the war. Things that you described are enough for a good offensive but not enough to end the war."
"@sklounst_them No, the drone wasn’t shot at"
"@ua_ydudar That’s very tough to say to be honest, they are trying to organize defenses. They allocated huge resources but I would rather describe them as chaotic, disorganized, armed mob than an army. They might or might not defend well, but it won’t be easy due to sheer numbers"
"7/ Update on the emergency beacon. After discussions, we are starting to think that beacons are unlikely to be used for targeting, but rather were a result of the unskillful attempt to attach the beacon to the drone. The beacon was likely used to track the drone https://t.co/25cxqjdZMi"
6/ The forthcoming stage of the battle for Bakhmut is likely to unfold soon. https://t.co/83kD6vEn2P
"5/ Unless other countries, such as China, agree to provide or sell weapons and ammo in large quantities, I doubt that Russia will be able to restore its capabilities to perform coordinated large-scale operations on an operational or strategic level in the foreseeable future."
"4/ The enemy has established an echelon-like organizational structure to sustain their offensives, which allows them to effectively rotate their troops. However, it is noteworthy that the number of combat-ready equipment at their disposal is gradually decreasing."
3/  This indicates a persistent disparity in situational understanding between the military on the ground and the political leadership.
"2/ The formation of assault groups by Russian forces suggests a persistent demand for further assaults. However, it is observed that many of these groups lack experienced or motivated personnel to effectively operate on the battlefield."

"4/ Temporary assault formations are created for specific missions and do not receive additional training or time to build unit coordination. Once the mission is completed, the formation is disbanded and soldiers return to their regular platoons and companies until the next task."
"3/ There are also temporary assault units/groups assembled within a regiment or battalion for a specific assault operation, they do not have number, name, defined structure, regular commanders, or armament, but are instead tailored to each mission's specific requirements"

"@PoliticalSage @PhillipsPOBrien It's hard to estimate, that's why I say damaged or destroyed, especially if they were able to evacuate it - no way to say if it was just a small issue and crew abandoned the vehicle, or it's a major damage that requires serious repairs, unless vehicle caught on fire from inside."

Vuhledar 06.02 - 19:10 update: 🇺🇦
"Great news. Throughout the day, the enemy attempted a series of assaults in Vuhledar's direction. Up to 30 armored vehicles of different types have been either damaged or completely destroyed. Hopefully videos will be released soon to public"
"@NOELreports Got it. I guess we both made incorrect statements because saying that they do not have/do not form offensive formations in the area is incorrect, but also saying that they are definitely going for offensive is also incorrect."
"@j2ooj Armies include brigades, there are reserve units which are not used for breakthrough assaults, but follow vanguard units. Brigade might not be present as a whole, and can dispatch just one battalion. So you can end up with few battalions from different brigades and armies."
"@HenryWi86212968 @SilotipsIV While Vuhledar is more strategically important (this is just my opinion, many people might disagree) if the Wagner will take Bakhmut even partially, it will be a big political gain for Prigozhyn, who obviously plays his own game and thinks about his place in Russia after Putin."
"@SilotipsIV Mostly with units which previously sustained critical losses and were rotated out to replenish losses. They are staffed with mobilized soldiers and officers. If they failed to achieve results with 155th and 40th brigades, I don't see what can these guys achieve anything"
"4/4 While the enemy continues to saturate the area with artillery and infantry, it's unclear whether the enemy is planning to develop another large-scale offensive with lower-quality troops or concentrate more troops to make small, tactical advancements."
"3/4 At the same time, it's important not to rush to conclusions based on large concentrations, because the quality of reserves is lower than the quality of destroyed units - 155th and 40th brigades."
2/4 The enemy hasn't stopped moving additional forces in the Vuhledar area and has concentrated sizeable forces made of mixed units from different brigades and armies.
🧵Vuhledar🇺🇦 06.02 - 08:00 AM update:
"1/4 The current situation around Vuhledar is stable. The enemy continues assaults with small infantry groups covered by artillery and indirect tank fire, however without any success. The enemy is hesitant to perform large-scale attacks."

"@johhann79 @sentdefender Are you talking about Shoigu, who has ""General of the Army"" rank without serving a single day in the army? Got it."
"@NOELreports They are definitely grouping up for an attack. Without giving a number, what they have gathered so far is larger than initial force which they used at first, when 155th and 40th tried to rush into Vuhledar. They keep adding up more forces every day, non-stop."
@DefMon3 The trolling goes further.

Damage control from the ruzzian propaganda playbook:
Step 1: Fail an offensive
Step 2: Claim that the enemy is planning to attack
Step 3: Wait a few days
Step 4: Claim that the enemy offensive failed due to your pre-emptive strike that thwarted enemy plans to launch an offensive. https://t.co/OarIHHrIOV

"@ilyadx I can probably say that they do not exist as a brigade anymore. Their ""core"" has been annihilated several times. Others are severely crippled - no limbs, eyes etc. "
"The losses are getting replaced with mobilized, so the name 155th is more of a façade right now."

"@pmakela1 These are just few published videos, there are much more unpublished stuff. Hopefully they will get released soon. Enemy losses are just staggering. Sometimes they got 50% of the assaulting company KIA in a single assault, some of these instances were recorded."
"@KlasTommy They can, eventually, if they will keep bringing fresh troops from mobilized who haven't been there yet. This tactics is easily countered if we can destroy their artillery that covers assaulting infantry. We need more means to counter their artillery fire. Much more"
"4/4 You can also see how the enemy attempted to outflank Vuhledar from the East, but sustained losses and had to retreat to Mykil's'ke. "
Overall the situation remains dangerous due to increasing numbers of enemy infantry and artillery. https://t.co/ObF0QWUBIK
3/4 Fresh scorch marks on fresh snow can visually confirm that the enemy continues attempts to establish control over the dachi's area by covering  assaulting infantry groups with heavy artillery fire. https://t.co/P0ErhOgbwI

🧵Vuhledar🇺🇦 04.02 - 11:00 AM update:
1/4 No significant changes for the past 24 hours. The enemy continues to increase the number of artillery and infantry in the area. It seems that the enemy is preparing for slow grinding tactics which we have previously seen near Bakhmut. https://t.co/IszCtRtb8Q

"@MarcusMarchess1 @nothing6777876 Yes, the package is indeed great, but the problem is that we are still talking in terms of packages, while it should be streams, which is why lend-lease was adopted."
"@davitopia @Tendar Not that I heard of. Mostly the entire units (like a company) refuse to move on positions and ignore commands. Eventually, few days later they might pop up on the battlefield, but they just imitate attack - under minimal resistance they retreat. Happened before in Pavlivka"
@MarcusMarchess1 @nothing6777876 - not remotely enough
- using MRAPs and M113 doesn't require months of training
- the fact that many people in comments assume that it's enough just shows that people don't understand how destructive is this war.
"- it needs to be coming as a stream, not packages"
"@Tendar Another ""schrodinger claim"" from russians. It's true that fog makes drones and artillery blind, so they had to reduce assaults. But they still dispatched infantry groups which were successfully liquidated. Oh, they always forget to mention mutiny in 155th brigade and reserves 😉"

"@nothing6777876 If we will get enough weaponry from the West - Vuhledar can hold until the last russian soldier. But help needs to be delivered quick and constantly. It’s not only about wunderwaffe weapons - constant flow of ammo, armored transporters, mortars, thermals etc is needed."
"4/4 While I do not have information as to why they are in the area, it seems like they were hoping to enter Vuhledar right after the 155th and 40th brigades. Publicity stunt to market Shoigu's creation amidst growing popularity of the ""Wagner"" has failed."
"3/4 Ukrainian military expert Oleksandr Kovalenko recently said that the so-called private military company ""Patriot"", affiliated with Shoigu is present in the Vuhledar area, and I can confirm this information. However, they haven't participated in a single combat operation"
"2/4 The enemy attacks mostly during the daytime and reduces night-time combats, except for artillery shelling and brief tank shoot-and-scoot attacks: armed with thermal scopes(including French ones) tanks make 3-5 shots and then retreat."
"🧵Vuhledar🇺🇦, 03.02 - 07:00 AM update:"

"4/4 Personally, it seems that the enemy generals act like a gambler who is trying to win back the money he has lost, by borrowing even more money from friends and family. Because of this, this battle for Vuhledar is likely to be much longer and bloodier than it was anticipated."
"3/4 Instead, they frantically started to move units from other areas. For example, have moved one more brigade from the 3d army corps, and a few battalions from the 36th army. The enemy also abruptly moved reserves which were supposed to advance in a different sector."

"@crazyisrael1 @Danspiun @j2ooj Usually the reason is simple - when our side is silent, then relatives hear about the “advance”from russian sources, and get information from there.

"@Danspiun @j2ooj I think criticism would not be wrong. At that time it really appeared like that - it was anticipated for the morning, they intensified artillery fire as well as movements of some units, which looked like they finally decided to advance, but it didn’t develop. I should have waited"

@albert_hubble I might talk about it few months later
"@antiwatnic The situation is still difficult and can change at any time. The situation is somewhat improved but it's still developing, and too early to say anything. I don't need to read general staff to know what's happening in Vuhledar😉"
"@HenryWi86212968 The issue with losing Vuhledar is not only about railroad (which is obviously a big deal), but it also opens up some possibilities for them to advance northwards and westwards from here, which is not the best scenario, to put it lightly."
"4/4  It's possible that the enemy will utilize reserves from other directions and areas to retain the pressure. Enemy artillery fire continues to level Vuhledar. The enemy has used two of their elite naval brigades - 155th and 40th for this assault, highlighting the importance."
"3/4 The information spread by russian propagandists about reaching Vuhledar itself is factually incorrect. Their attempts to establish control over the eastern ""dachi"" area have failed so far. The situation overall remains difficult"
2/4
"The enemy attempted to use a large number of vehicles for the assault, but after losing the majority of its vehicles, switched tactics to constant small infantry squad assaults covered by non-stop artillery shelling. The enemy continues assault from Mykil's'ke and Pavlivka"
"🧵1/4 Vuhledar, 26.01 16:00 update: UAF continues to control Vuhledar and roads that connect with Vuhledar. The enemy tries to establish fire control over roads but so far failed to achieve its goals. The enemy failed to set up a foothold near Vuhledar https://t.co/tz3pcL1fX1"

This is where enemy puts maximum pressure. Should have specified which Dachi in previous tweet. https://t.co/FURsbkRBCS
"2/2 The situation remains difficult, the enemy had some successes in the ""dachi"" area and tries to establish control there to develop a further attack on the outskirts of Vuhledar. Despite high losses and deserters, the enemy continues to throw assault groups and shell the town."
"🧵1/2 Vuhledar, 25.01 19:00 update: Information about Russian forces setting up a foothold in Vuhledar is a part of their PsyOps🛑 At least two enemy units refused to assault after witnessing high casualties from first waves. Please, re-tweet. https://t.co/UzLXskqood"
"2/2 They actively use SU-25s and various helicopters to air-support the assault. The core of assaulting forces - 155th and 40th naval brigades, as well as auxiliary battalions from Donetsk. Despite heavy losses, the enemy continues assaulting attempts."
🧵1/2 Update on Vuhledar situation: enemy continues assault from several directions and tries to take a foothold in the residential area north of Pavlivka and Mykilske. The enemy shells Vuhledar almost non-stop for the second day from artillery.

"@asda30851 It really depends on the unit. Some units are completely made of mobiks, including officers, some made of experienced officers and soldiers mixed with freshly mobilized. They also attach volunteer battalions to regular assault VDV and Naval Infantry brigades. It's inconsistent."

"@Klaus_Roehl @bumpitumpi3 @KofmanMichael That's why they mobilize hundreds thousands of people. Many of them don't go on frontlines - they are involved in these sort of jobs.

"@Michazemanski Weird data assessment, in my opinion. The frontline is much smaller than it was in March-June 2022. They also made tactics adjustments on battlefield. They have delivery issues, which makes them fire less, but that's not a 75% drop, far from it."

"3. Because their logistical routes were disrupted, people falsely assumed that Russians are running out of ammo. This is false and factually incorrect"

"Story#4. Russian squad was dispatched to hold a tree line until further notice. In two weeks, nobody bothered to supply a unit with food or water. They left their positions only after their soldiers started to get sick from drinking puddle water."
Story#3. Soldiers from the entire unit for two months were unable to receive any mail from their homes. They almost rioted when they figured out that all their goods from the mail were simply stolen by their comrades on the main base.
"Story#2. A squad of RU soldiers armed only with firearms spent days under artillery fire and retreated after sustaining losses. Once they retreated to the nearby town, they were detained by a Wagner unit. The squad leader got his knee shot, while the rest got beaten and sent back"
Story#1. A unit of freshly mobilized arrives in a town not far from the frontline. A National Guard unit comprised of ethnic Chechens came to the unit and took away any valuable equipment such as thermal scopes. Those who decided to resist were beaten.

"This is also the reason why many Ukrainians until these days celebrate New Year and “Old New Year”, but that’s another topic. Orthodox Church of Ukraine started a celebration transition to 25.12, which also puts Ukraine closer to the rest of the world, parting away from Russia."
"While everyone in Ukraine is using the Gregorian calendar in their daily lives, the orthodox Church continues to use the Julian calendar to determine holiday days. After 4 centuries, the difference has accumulated and resulted in a 14-day gap."
"The issue was taken to Pope Gregory XIII, who decided to create a new calendar, which was called the Gregorian calendar – the one we are still using nowadays. Western Christian church has adopted a new calendar, while the Orthodox church continued using the Julian calendar."
"A year lasts 365 days, 5 hours, 48 ​​minutes, and 6 seconds. When the Julian calendar was created (45 BC), 5 hours were included, but 48 minutes and 6 seconds were omitted. As a result, in 1582, astronomer Aloysius Lilius noticed that the calendar ""lags behind"" the solar cycle."

これは特殊だが、両国の人々における百年に一度の強固な協力関係とパートナーシップを築くの良い機会であると私は思う。戦後ウクライナは日本にたくさんのビジネスチャンスをもたらし、双方の経済発展と安全協力はより良いものとなるだろう。
ウクライナは我々の領土からロシア人占領者を追い出すことに成功したが、戦争を終息させる為にはまだ武器が必要だ
私は日本の人々がこの戦争の為に共に戦うことを期待している訳ではないが、日本の対戦車や防空、装甲、ミサイル発射装置は戦争に打ち勝つために大いに役立ち、尚且つ日本の武器を売り込む事につながるだろう。 https://t.co/oglAjHh9un
戦地での成功的な武器使用はもっとも良いマーケティング戦略である。ロシアがウクライナの発電所や学校、病院、市民が住むアパートへの攻撃を続けるのなら、ウクライナは世界で最も強大な軍隊をもつ国のひとつであるロシアに立ち向かい、最前線で戦うであろう。 https://t.co/zXTDeaq8bi
日本は現代の優秀な科学者や技術者と同様に、武術や古来からのしきたりといったものが有名である。私は日本の人々が善意でウクライナを助けるとは思っていない。しかし東芝や三菱、川崎といった軍事産業が自社の製品を売り込む滅多とない機会である。
そして核兵器を保有していない国々にどのようなメッセージを送るだろうか? ロシアのような国々は他国の領土的一体性を認めず、それ故に違法に占拠した日本の北方領土やウクライナのクリミア半島に対する交渉を拒否している。ロシアの取り決めを尊重しない姿勢は外交における弱点である。 https://t.co/Fp25Uppc0w
果たして我々は核戦争の脅威を振りかざす、一部の孤立した国々が物事を決める世界で子どもを育てたいだろうか?諸外国が台湾の軍事的解決を考えるまでにどれぐらいかかるだろうか?どのようなメッセージを北朝鮮やイランに送るだろうか?越えてはいけない一線はどこだろうか? https://t.co/24nTDs1C4T
このロシアによる行動は結果として全世界に悪影響を及ぼしている。もしロシアのような国々が帝国戦争による征服を遂行し続けるなら、戦後の安全協定は無意味なものとなり、また核を保有しているという理由で、如何なる国も他国に対する侵略や併合する事ができるだろう。
🇺🇦🇯🇵日本とウクライナはあまりにも遠く、ウクライナで起こっている出来事は日本にとっては無関係のように感じるかもしれない。しかしながら国際社会において、ロシアのウクライナ侵攻は難民問題や食糧不足、エネルギー価格の高騰、物流ルートの妨害など、世界中の何億人もの人々に影響を及ぼしている。 https://t.co/iiXUWLYoSS

"@BullTesla @byrddw14 Your original argument was about IFV, now you transitioned to the SPA. Do you know why? Because tank can have universal use in combined arms warfare. You can’t use howitzer like a tank, and you can’t use IFV like a howitzer. Not every company has their own howitzers."
"@Purrupupues You don’t usually even use artillery to hit a single tank (unless it’s guided munition). Going after 10km is also not the best range, because it’s enough stay 5-6 km to avoid AT fire. You want to hit buildings and fortifications with infantry inside, and tanks do it well"

"I think it’s time for the West to work on providing Ukraine🇺🇦 with even more guided munitions, AT means, as well as even older tanks, crew training, and logistics support, as tanks are still a major force in this war."
"It’s understandable why the general public is amused by the presence of the Russian T-62, nevertheless, its 115mm gun continues to cause destruction and kill people. AT ammo supplies are depleting, but old Russian tanks are still coming. https://t.co/P0mdunx5mC"
"I agree that some tank doctrines are obsolete, but not a tank itself. It remains a “Swiss-army-knife” solution for many situations due to its adaptability. Any slightly modernized tank from the 80-90s can expand Ukraine’s both defensive and offensive capabilities. https://t.co/eOrNgKQXH2"

"@docdailey You are correct, ATACMS can be intercepted, that's why I tried to emphasize on ""deep strike weapons"" rather than ATACMS solely. In my opinion, the combination of different types such as long-ranged loitering munitions, HARMs and ATACMS will do the job."
@nefthy @MoulderNeil I have feeling that you didn't read my article at all - it specifically focuses on why HIMARS doesn't solve the problem which I outline...
@Keren_Mice Put HIMARS in a range of a platoon mortar to hit empty buildings? I don’t think that’s a good idea
"@jungel82498352 You probably don’t want to move HIMARS right on the edge, where it can be easily located and destroyed. But even if you will make the move, that spot is not used as a major hub anymore, which is the point I am making"
"@Kmrtnsn2 You would be surprised, but destroying bridges is very difficult task, unless you have direct access to the bridge. It took almost a month for HIMARS to critically damage the bridge in Kherson. Give us more powerful stuff, we will fuck those bridges up, don’t doubt."

@Jimjones0124 @WengerBalI I really doubt much left. Or at least in significant numbers to make any difference. They are also not very accurate/can be intercepted

"Weapons that provide Ukraine with deep strike capabilities are not prolonging the conflict but saving thousands of lives in Ukraine, and helping to end this conflict quicker."
"There is a difference between a victory, where you lose a few hundred people per month, versus where you lose a few thousand people per month. Multiply that by 12 to see the difference after one year. This is the difference that deep strike weapons can make."
"Any army without a command chain, communications, fuel, and ammo is not an army, but a lost and hungry mob. They will retreat on their own.  If the West will supply Ukraine with means to strike beyond 200 km, it will create enough pressure to push Russians out of Ukraine. https://t.co/IuIiAZ4SMU"
"To counter that, Russians distribute ammo in small portions and store it separately. This works because the major storage facilities are still outside of the HIMARS range. If they would move them further, Russians would have to drive at least 350 km for an ammo distribution https://t.co/t3AoVyh8TS"
"Once Ukraine got GMLRS with a long enough range, Russians moved the equipment further away, which caused additional logistical hardships. This especially becomes a problem when Russians need to drive hundreds of kilometers daily for purely military or supply operations."
"3. Supply depot. Another lost opportunity to strike – the enemy was keeping approximately 60 vehicles of different types – armored and cargo trucks, AFV’s, etc. Destruction of this base would equal the elimination of one regiment’s armor. https://t.co/cm28TmXtA3"
"This facility is operational since Spring 2022, and it’s just one of many. Destruction of such facilities would force Russia to move them deeper into the territory, creating numerous problems for vehicle evacuation, delivery, and spare part cannibalization."
"2. Combat Vehicle repair facility near Dzhankoi. While the destruction of HQs and ammo depots might seem obvious, the destruction of maintenance and repair facilities is crucial too, as it denies the ability to restore the combat readiness of mechanized and motorized units. https://t.co/Xs2MhWEltO"
"Even if the area would be still heavily used, Ukraine still has difficulties reaching it. This clearly demonstrates that despite continuous claims from some military experts, HIMARS is clearly not a panacea to all problems. https://t.co/qoc4kpjA9E"
"This hub remains unharmed until this day, although it has lost its significance, as the enemy moved into a different location. Longer-range weaponry would have forced the enemy to push his logistics further away, making it difficult to run both offensive and defensive operations. https://t.co/EvanZntyFG"
"1. Kherson front logistics hub near Preobrazhenka, in close proximity to Crimea. Destruction of one logistics hub like this can easily cripple multiple brigades. Destruction of multiple logistics hubs can result in the logistics collapse of the entire front. https://t.co/Md8ObUvmlp"
"Despite clear successes, the absence of tactical missiles, or deep strike capability weapons, as well as a limited number of GMLRS systems reduces the offensive capabilities of the Ukrainian army and results in casualties that could have been avoided. Let’s take a closer look"
"If you have been following Kherson and Kharkiv operations, you probably noticed that without supplies, communications and organized command Russian frontlines collapsed and resulted in retreat."

@Guillau15264609 @ratnapelle @AndrewPerpetua US has large stockpiles of artillery in its reserves. Most of that artillery is discounted and no longer in active service
"@2little2lateBB @ratnapelle @AndrewPerpetua I didn't offer volley solution though, I was saying that Russia has upper hand because they can use mass volley, while we have limited number of artillery + ammo to it, which means that even if we hit few pieces of their artillery, they replace it fairly quick."
"@2little2lateBB @ratnapelle @AndrewPerpetua If I know that in X place we have 7 semi-functional howitzers, no supplies of modern AT ammo since August, and enemy stopped to change artillery positions because we can't respond since September, then yes, I think they pull things out of their own arses."
"@2little2lateBB @ratnapelle @AndrewPerpetua I have bad news for you. I am well aware of the situation on several ""dilyankas"", which means ""frontline area"", I know a precise number of means that we have there, and almost precise numbers of what enemy has. When I say what I say, I don't pull it out of my ass"
@2little2lateBB @ratnapelle @AndrewPerpetua US and NATO in general have much more resources available than it was provided to Ukraine. No weapons is worse than weapons with imperfect logistics.
"You mean clever fighting by sitting in trenches under constant artillery fire for months, without any ability to respond?"

"@ratnapelle @AndrewPerpetua Much more is required. While people laugh at “old Soviet crap” that Russians use, if you put 20 old howitzers and make a volley, it will hurt you just as much. From the feedback that I get, European artillery is not that great for such an intensive use in such limited numbers."
"@RALee85 @DefMon3 Thank you for your work, have been following your threads since March, when I had time!"
"@AndrewPerpetua In some areas it’s even worse. I try not to publish such information, but Ukraine needs more artillery, especially long-ranged one. In some areas of the frontline, the artillery ratio is approximately 10 to 1, by the most conservative estimates."
"@DefMon3 @RALee85 @RALee85  You can ignore my comment. I am baka, and need to work on my reading comprehension 😂"
@DefMon3 @RALee85 I might have misunderstood. I thought that he was saying that Ukrainian soldiers think that tanks are no longer relevant.
@RALee85 Who told you that Ukrainian soldiers disagree about relevance of tanks? In particular we should be skeptical of generalizations 😜
"@VlastimilBalaty @SoKiell @pembaril @CoondawgCooney Until I won’t see our guys actually flying A-10s, we can only state that Ukrainian pilots were training on A-10 simulators."
"@SoKiell I agree. Unfortunately, it seems like some people don’t get that due to the globalization, large war in the 21st century affects literally everyone. You can’t just sit somewhere “out there”, and expect that it won’t affect you. Absolutely naive"
"Only continuous military, economical and diplomatic pressure on Russia can stop this war and prevent further escalation."
"Ukrainians are not going to give up and surrender even if that would mean no heat, no gas, and no electricity. The best way to stop this is to provide Ukraine with more AD systems and other means that will help Ukrainians to protect themselves."
"This can help people to understand why Kremlin is destroying power and heating plants, causing zero effect on troops' efficiency. They are not trying to destroy the military - they are trying to create such a crisis that would be too expensive for the West to handle."
"I do not think that Russia is going to de-escalate the situation – they are planning to escalate this further, regardless of whether the West will increase or decrease support to Ukraine, hence whatever Kremlin says about Western help is completely irrelevant."
"Opinion. Kremlin aims to create an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the wintertime, by shutting off the central heating and electricity. Given that Europe has its struggles, another “winter refugee wave” is a great leverage for Kremlin to push for negotiations on its terms."
"The situation quickly changed in September and October, when Russia received loitering munition from Iran. The described scenario started to play out, but on a much larger scale. It has nothing to do with the Crimean bridge – the plan was executed once Russia received the means."
"The information itself was questioned, as the usage of S-300 on that distance would unlikely lead to desired results. Another argument was that the destruction of heating plants would make more sense closer to winter. Needless to say, it didn’t happen on the 24th of August"
"In August, I received information that Russia is planning to inflict critical damage on heating and power plants on the 24th of August. The plan was to utilize S-300 launchers in Belarus (SSM mode), to destroy heating and power plants in Kyiv, causing a humanitarian crisis."

"@ji_stark The point is that C&amp;C is gone. Which is exactly why it's already too late to hit C2, and the reason I published it. By the time when HIMARS will get close enough to hit airstrip, they will move helicopters too"
"We know their C2s locations. We know what they had for breakfast. Yet, we don’t have the means to strike them. I will continue providing imagery to show you all the lost opportunities for the past months. TBM/ATACMS could have changed the game a long time ago. It’s not too late."

@ToddHeadleeAZ @Spriter99880 The Ukraine war is totally a USA problem. You need to understand that it was the US that started the war since 2014 by continuing to push for our mobile army-NATO closer to the Russian border despite the US promise and agreement. Zelensky is just the sheep of US. Wake up man!
"Russia has been having this dream to better than America since John Kennedy’s presidency. Vladimir Putin became a practician of this dream. He invaded Ukraine to gain more resources (food, coal, technology, weapons) and he lost. Russia is losing the war, losing culture, itself."
@Spriter99880 One might think he'd be committing those bombers to Ukraine... except they'd probably be shot down.
Is NATO supposed to be frightened by this?
"One of the worst casualties of the Ukraine war has been the reputation of the Russian military, especially their command and control."

@Kaizen__8 @yanisvaroufakis 14000 is the total sum of dead in Donbass war from 2014-22. It includes over 10000 combatants both from Ukrainian and Russian/separatist forces. Not all of the civilians killed were ‘ethnic Russians’ and not all of them were killed by Ukraine.

2) demonising Russia China Americas and AU by moralising and mostly economic antagonism. Impatience.

But that will not happen. Neither will Russia bent itself and obey  to NATO.

"@ALTIPLANIAN @SonjaEnde I somehow doubt it, since it is Russia burning orthodox churches.

@celobr10 @HuntressHusky @CaseyCoffman @RobertKennedyJr @codepink The West betrayed the people in east Ukraine with their duplicitous Minsk negotiations. Buying time for war is antithetical to a humanitarian mission.
Crimea has been part of Russia for over 200 years until collapse of Soviet Union. There was a referendum albeit disputed
@KimDotcom @LPofCT Turning Ukraine into a wasteland like Iraq where birth defects and cancers are the norm. Depleted Uranium munitions are a war crime.

@rishibagree Did you analyse why this increase?. After Ukraine war we import crude oil from Russia on rupee payment and after process  export to EU nation's on dollar.Russia is saddled with large chunks of Indian rupee of no use. They have stopped rupee pmt now.see next 6 month's level Bakri.

Fits their #globalist agenda
@VictoryDay_Hope It seems to me that the protests in Serbia are fomented by Washington.
Because the Serbian government did not forget the depleted uranium bombs dropped on them by USA
So does not support the USA proxy war in Ukraine
@bungarsargon I agree with you about the Ukraine thing. He just made it about being a warmonger or not being a warmonger. There's at least a few % of the undecided electorate that will vote for no war as the primary issue. The media will knee jerk and go for more war. Which will backfire.

@JakeBequette91 He disqualified himself when he first was against the Ukraine war and then was for it after his financial backers told him to.
@LegionHoops Does he want to go to Ukraine and assist in the war?
@keithamccluske1 @Lyla_lilas You can forget the entirety of this your argument.
Trump would have sold Ukraine to Putin saying he ended a war thus.

We watched a documentary last night on the war crimes documentation efforts in Ukraine.  It was horrific.  It is incomprehensible how any nation can remain neutral about this war.
@Ggirl682268 @FoxNews My point is that there is not a group of countries that would likely come together to fight NATO on a World War basis. Russia &amp; Ukraine are fighting &amp; Ukraine is getting a lot of support but no other countries are fighting in that conflict so it’s not WWIII now either.
"@erikalmqvist Hungary is irrelevant, but the unconditional support of Ukraine ""as long as it takes"" is an irresponsible and risky strategy if it is not followed by diplomatic efforts to end the war through negotiations."
"@NEWSMAX The Ukraine war isn’t popular among anyone outside of the elites, leftists, and globalists. WE THE PEOPLE want our own country secure and protected."

And it is not Ukraine who kills these young men.
@RobertKennedyJr @codepink We've been trying to provoke Russia for years. They just needed a concrete pretext for an actual engagement. They finally found one in Ukraine. Then the war machine was happy again.
@kaishou_taikei Some of visible benefits of war in Ukraine for the west:
1. Influx of fresh white young women and children to the aging EU
2. Expansion of NATO
3. Getting rid of old weaponry by shipping it all to Ukraine
4. Weakening Russia
5. Arm manufacturers prosper etc.
"@BobDeBo60191784 @ZelenskyyUa NATO did nothing to stop russians in Ukraine, this is not about NATO. This is about the only agressor = Russia. Unimaginable evil. They can only kill, loot, rape (even children and toddlers), torture, behead and cut out genitals war prisoners. Monsters from hell !"
This is all despite his involvement in the ‘Second Сhechen War’ and the war in Ukraine. Now he also has an issue with “takfir” and says this comes from the Russians who divided us. Because it’s precisely the takfir of the Kаdyrovitеs that allowed us to fight and kill them.

70 fighter planes are now heading to Ukrainw from NATO nations.
There are senior NATO officers in Ukraine 'advising' and many rumours that there are 'sheep dipped' NATO soldiers in Ukranian uniforms fighting this war.
But without causing any serious damage. It nearly worked until Johnson dashed off to Ukraine to persuade Zelenskyy not to sign.
"Since then, Russia has fought more resolutely but still avoided killing civilians. Still trying to prevent an 'all out' war."
"The next effort to avert war was December 2021, when the draft peace treaties were proposed. Spurned, Putin once again showed he meant business, and invaded Ukraine."
"But even then, he sent in a force large enough to show he meant business, to persuade Ukraine to make peace."
@juneslater17 Russia has wanted to fight with UK before he went after Ukraine. They had been testing our airspace for a while. I don’t think people using a pic of a flag warrants a war do you?

Trump is highly anti-war.

@JoePopulista @rltone22 @Spriter99880 Victory hmm so Russia takes Ukraine that is happy end for you? Same as Hitler after Austria went for More so will Putin so you cheering big war and lots of deaths? Injustice? Child rapes? Wtf are you.
"@Spriter99880 Zelensky is shooting himself in the foot, because it is probable that Trump might win the election before Ukraine's war is over.  Zelensky is making an enemy of Trump. Stupid move."
The strongest argument to support a negotiated peace settlement in Ukraine is the suffering the war is causing in the Global South and it's only going to get worse.

"@keithamccluske1 @FunkyTramp @TorNygard2 @Lyla_lilas His two other approaches child be to pull all aid and let it play out, claiming the war is over and russia won, then ignore the consequences, or go all in on removing russia's military from Ukraine which could risk retaliation from russia."
@yanisvaroufakis Can I get an answer? What about an alternative peace plan like Russia get the fuck out of Ukraine and the war is over? Isn’t that much simpler and faster?
"@calvinrobinson Trump has said he’d achieve cessation of hostilities within 24 hours if made President, but has refused to say how. Given his admiration of Putin, safe bet he’d encourage him to occupy all of Ukraine"

@sentdefender Ukraine has been fully invaded by Russia. Ukraine is at full scale war with Russia and Russia is bombing Ukraine cities for over a year now. Ukraine has every right to retaliate against the aggressor bombing their country. Russia can just leave Ukraine.
Had he been successful  for significant retaliation inside Russia we perhaps could have seen a potential positive  response to cease fire.
Russia has  no incentives to cease fire.

To blame for the war between Russia and Ukraine?
@keithamccluske1 @Lyla_lilas Crimea was part of Ukraine. It was illegally annexed by Russia. But what Zelenskyy is talking about is the war that started in 2014 when Russia attempted to seize the Donbass. It was still ongoing at the time of the invasion.
@Trollstoy88 you are all set for war with NATO ?....you have a war in Ukraine you better focus on....your ships can not get to Black Sea.....Turkey will not allow passage.

@keithamccluske1 @Lyla_lilas It is factual. Russia invaded Donbass in 2014 and has fought a war there ever since.
It is not the responsibility of any US president to stop this war. It is the responsibility of the Russian president. He should withdraw from Ukraine's territory. Completely.
@SardaranCarol @Iron7allica_ Indeed they were! The UK definitely would have won last year if it wasn’t for the war in Ukraine. I support Ukraine but they definitely did get the pity vote last year.

@jennyeclair Mine went up by 10p! Too many people buying too expensive places and clearly getting a rubbish mortgage to fund it. Then not taking out mortgage insurance cos they don't have any money left. It's the price of getting involved in Ukraine's war with sanctions against Russia.
@TarikCyrilAmar Putin had ALREADY invaded Ukraine and declared his annexation of Crimea. PUTIN HAD ALREADY ATTACKED AND INVADED. That is what Ukraine was stalling. Putin's war of aggression. Which you shill for.
The real comfort zone for people is “not talking”
Talking has risks associated with it. There is more data to judge you.
But not talking at a macro level can lead to wars such as Russia - Ukraine.
There are many reasons for the war but a very human reason is when both parties… https://t.co/4T4GxcsRO6

5. I would expect that we will see days if not weeks of relentless destruction of Russia's war making capabilities in Ukraine and when the Russian murder machine is burning we might then expect to see newly formed Ukrainian mechanized combined arms forces attack sometime in June.
3. cruise missiles follows while the Russians chase decoys.  This is the type of modern warfare that we would employ in a war with Russia or China but until now Ukraine could only dream of having such a capability. The first two days have proven how well this strategy works. https://t.co/rcWEklhBAE
"1. The war comes to #Luhansk. Far from the front, Luhansk city has been beyond the range of Ukrainian missiles so it is used for Russian and LNR command and logistics.

The war fueled by the US support for Ukraine was a golden opportunity for Russia to depopulate the conquered areas. The next phase is populating those areas with Russian people. Those areas are forever gone.
That would have not happened if Ukraine &amp; Russia had negotiated a deal. https://t.co/kMwETioxwD

"@TheWarMonitor It surprised me to hear about it too. It seems the quid pro quo, was to get rid of someone that was leaking information that went to the SBF agents planted in Ukraine's MoD. Also too, Russia's research center and ammo dumps experienced smoking accidents in the run up to the war."
@TheJewbyrd7777 @ItsArtoir Really? The USA has spent more money supporting Ukraine than they did during the whole of Vietnam war. If the USA pulled out Ukraine would be done. The UK should not be getting involved in someone else's war. Don't believe everything you see on tv

"@waynerothe @Lyla_lilas @JerryTamburino It would prolong the war and make it bloodier, but Ukraine will remain after Trump is gone. "
Ukraine won't stop fighting and we in Europe won't stop supporting them.
Besides you won't reelect past mistakes.
@AdamKinzinger Trump wants the war between Ukraine and Russia to stop.
"He wants to stop the innocent people from being killed. Haven’t you learned, no one really wins in a war."
@Spriter99880 US n Europe have outsourced the war on Russia to Ukraine. Simple as that.

"@RobertR63834062 @philabook @OliverGrayHound @GunterFehlinger The idea of a legal or illegal war is ludicrous. Wars happen when all that shit goes out the window. As far as Ukraine taking Moscow, you are dreaming. Winning the war is possible, but Ukraine is not marching on Moscow to do it."
@jacopo_iacoboni Stai ripetendo la propaganda US-UK
Vietnam: Gulf of Tonkin

these things will always exist
human beings will always make such decisions
that's why my suggestion:
Never ever trust an outsider
