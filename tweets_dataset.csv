833,833.0,833.0,833,"@FouthTimeLucky It takes time to make it instinctive. We saw them train for 4 months with the 300 polish tanks before they started showing up on the battle field. There is gonna be a lot of new battalions, it takes time to make them functional."
834,834.0,834.0,834,So some of the offensive units have been in training and expanding since late summer. I don't think 47 Brigaded have seen combat yet. And there are plenty of examples.
835,835.0,835.0,835,@OGopnik Nope.

841,841.0,841.0,841,"@BroderickOyame1 @Fireblade577 Please tell me why you think the strategy in Bakhmut is a success? I'm not saying it isn't but I'm interested in your analysis of the attrition ratios, munition expenditure, use of offensive units to defend etc."

843,843.0,843.0,843,"I did not claim ""Bakhmut is a feint"". I suggested this might be what the Russians will say when they fail to take it. It's too soon to determine of the defense of Bakhmut was a success or not. It will probably take years."
844,844.0,844.0,844,@BroderickOyame1 @Fireblade577 That does not make your previous statement more true. And you don't know the decision to hold on to Bakhmut was made by the AFU. It's most likely a political decisions.
845,845.0,845.0,845,@bigSAC10 I think this is why we saw them just laying still in trenches in December when being hit. I think they have been trained to play dead.
846,846.0,846.0,846,"@l_maksim It's the frontlines, Sometimes you just have to dig where you are.

855,855.0,855.0,855,It's very likely RuAF will continue to reinforce their success in Avdiivka and it might even be a good excuse for not taking Bakhmut. Remember these words:
856,856.0,856.0,856,Bakhmut was just a feint
857,857.0,857.0,857,"According to RUMINT, UA lost SAM capabilities in the Avdiivka area and it has allowed the Russians to use attack aircraft on medium to high altitude in the area, out of range for MANPADS. This might explain why RuAF have had success."

862,862.0,862.0,862,"Hopefully UA have a long term plan for Bakhmut and have done the math on the subject.  It's possible they see it as a Kursk scenario, and if they have a plan for an upcoming offensive, the math might tell them it's worth it."
863,863.0,863.0,863,"It's pretty simple, when you are being shot at from 3 directions and the enemy are shooting at your GLOC, you are not in a good position. This is still true even if the RU advance have stopped. This is why I've been saying it might be time to leave Bakhmut."
864,864.0,864.0,864,"I still believe the UA position in Bakhmut is favorable. The attrition ratio is not nearly as favorable as it was in December, I'm hearing numbers much lower than those which circulate in western media. However, I believe the ratio have turned slightly in UA favor the last weeks."
865,865.0,865.0,865,The two most likely scenarios for Bakhmut at this point is:
866,866.0,866.0,866,1. The RU offensive comes to a halt due to attrition and Bakhmut becomes the new Marinka.
867,867.0,867.0,867,2. RuAF rotate forces and manage to do one last push forcing the AFU to withdraw.

1083,1083.0,1083.0,1083,@VictorishB123 I think they are using some of what they saved for an offensive. Just like they used some units dedicated for a spring offensive.
1084,1084.0,1084.0,1084,Some time during the summer is also when most experts believe RuAF will start running in to some real issues with ammunition.
1085,1085.0,1085.0,1085,"I think we will see another month or so with RuAF having the upper hand. Possibly a bit slower May. But some time during June, I think we might see the AFU starting to operate more offensively."
1086,1086.0,1086.0,1086,"I have expressed disagreement with the defense of Bakhmut. This is not because I think UA are doing the wrong thing over all, but rather I think they need to sacrifice more land for time and RU bodies rather than sacrificing UA soldiers."
1087,1087.0,1087.0,1087,"What I believe we are seeing right now is kind of what we saw during the summer. UA are trying to reconstitute offensive potential while defending with ""minimal"" resources. That being said, those minimal resources are much greater now than during the summer."
1088,1088.0,1088.0,1088,"RuAF have gradually stepped up their efforts to attack Bakhmut since the fall Yakovlivka, and after the fall of Soledar they really stepped it up in late January."
1089,1089.0,1089.0,1089,"After Yakovlivka was captured RuAF had the upper hand, the AFU had exhausted a lot of their combat potential during the fall offensive."
1090,1090.0,1090.0,1090,RuAF managed to capture Yakovlivka in early December after committing more resources to the area (VDV). At this point RuAF gradually started introducing more and more of the personnel which was mobilized in October.

1092,1092.0,1092.0,1092,RuAF have during and after the withdrawal from Kherson successfully trained their mobiks for around 3 months. integrated them in to their regular units (and created new ones). They have moved a lot of the assault units from Kherson to Bakhmut and Kreminna.
1093,1093.0,1093.0,1093,"At this point in time, I'm leaning towards RU made a rational decision to withdraw over time from Kherson (they did so quite successfully) to continue their offensive during the winter and possibly gain the upper hand. I think this was a wise and important decision by RU."
1094,1094.0,1094.0,1094,"I also think they realized they would not be able to do any kind of offensives west of the Dnipro and deemed it too costly to try to keep it. They could instead withdraw their units, reconstitute their combat potential and use them elsewhere."
1095,1095.0,1095.0,1095,"But even after a UA breakthrough of RU lines, RuAF managed to stop the AFU by sending reinforcements after just a few days. "
1096,1096.0,1096.0,1096,At this point RuAF successfully restored GLOC over the NK dam with temporary bridges and I thin they could have stayed in Kherson the year out.
1097,1097.0,1097.0,1097,"During this time AFU attempted ground assaults in both the south and north part of Kherson region, with mixed results. Mostly unsuccessful. They did have some success in the northern part which proved to be the most difficult to supply for RuAF."
1098,1098.0,1098.0,1098,"Once that was done, AFU stepped up their effort to attack RuAF GLOC in the Kherson region, especially bridges and barges. While having some initial success surprising  RU logistics, RuAF quickly adapted using barges from different launch locations."
1099,1099.0,1099.0,1099,"Late summer, early fall, Ukraine managed to recaptured large parts of Kharkiv region as a result of attrition and low morale and a severe personnel shortage RuAF were unable to defend Kharkiv region."

1101,1101.0,1101.0,1101,"During that time Ukraine accumulated equipment and trained troops, while starting strike RU logistic targets with HIMARS. At the same time, RuAF decided to move almost all their VDV units, plus Eastern and Central Military district away from Kharkiv region."
1102,1102.0,1102.0,1102,"Ukraine spend the summer training and building offensive potential in their units while defending all along the frontline with minimal resources, There were multiple reports from the frontlines about them not having enough resources"
1103,1103.0,1103.0,1103,"RuAF have been on the offensive for more than 1.5 month now and offensive operations like that does wear on both equipment, personnel and local ammunition stocks. I do not see them continuing this pace of attacks for more than another month or so. Many unknown variables."

4003,4003.0,4003.0,4003,@david1lz It's absolutely realistic based on my current understanding. Wagner is really tailored for assaults. They don't have time or resources to prepare defenses and train commanders for defensive operation. It's absolutely possible to force them to retreat and take back Bakhmut quickly
4004,4004.0,4004.0,4004,"@SpiritWar7 I am not sure about it, because cutting off Debaltseve - main supply route between Luhansk-Horlivka-Debalteseve might be a better option."

4011,4011.0,4011.0,4011,"12/ While this is mere speculation on my part, considering the poor state of their troops in Bakhmut, launching a counter-offensive in this direction could cause a serious blow to russian morale. This is just one of many potential directions for such an attack."
4012,4012.0,4012.0,4012,"11/ While it's unclear if our command will decide to counter-attack in the area, it's quite possible that what russia was able to achieve in the course of 9 months will be reversed within a week and result in a breakthrough and encirclement of Horlivka and the rears of Donetsk."
4013,4013.0,4013.0,4013,"10/ Wagner troops lack both training and experience in preparing complex and organized defenses. Organizing defenses, establishing firing positions, and managing logistics in a well-structured manner is difficult, and Wagner is not designed or equipped for it."
4014,4014.0,4014.0,4014,"9/ Without artillery superiority on the field, Wagner's tactics don't work and yield no results and lead to fruitless and unsustainable casualty ratios. We need much more ammo, artillery and other counter-battery means to nullify their assault capabilities."
4015,4015.0,4015.0,4015,"8/ However, Prigozhin himself admitted that without artillery ammo, Wagner is ineffective, and they can only move forward with huge losses that they cannot sustain. The MoD seems reluctant to provide more support, likely due to their fear of a counter-attack at any moment."
4016,4016.0,4016.0,4016,"7/ In Bakhmut, Wagner manages to move forward by turning defensive positions into rubble with intense artillery, mortar, TOS, and air support fire. They are also aware of the Ukrainian forces' lack of artillery ammunition and are not afraid of counter-battery fire."
4017,4017.0,4017.0,4017,"6/ Example: A newly formed ""Wolves"" squad drove to Ukrainian lines without coordination, attempting to ""gain reputation"". However, due to their lack of knowledge about the area and the situation, they drove into a landmine and died. The wounded members had to be evacuated."
4018,4018.0,4018.0,4018,"5/ The emergence of multiple ""PMCs"": Wagner, Potok, Veteran, Yenisey, Skif, Tigr, Irbis, Rys' and Wolves have created additional coordination complexities, including logistical challenges, a lack of clear command chains, and insufficient intelligence exchange and coordination."
4019,4019.0,4019.0,4019,"4/ Poor cooperation between Wagner and MoD results in a lack of coordination between them. The MoD only establishes control over territories captured by Wagner, while Wagner continues to assault forward without proper coordination."
4020,4020.0,4020.0,4020,"3/ Serious tensions exist between Wagner and the Ministry of Defense. These tensions exist not only at the top level but also at the regular level. Some Wagner units act as policing forces, commit crimes, and openly disrespect military commanders with impunity."
4021,4021.0,4021.0,4021,"2/ Wagner convicts have limited value and only make advances when heavy artillery fire is present. If the artillery is suppressed or runs out of ammunition, they don't make progress. Unfortunately, the lack of ammunition on our side hinders counter-battery fire."
4022,4022.0,4022.0,4022,"🧵Given the recent speech by Prigozhin, it is important to clarify the situation in Bakhmut.

@David_K_Clark Such numbers don't even tell a fraction of the story. Include humanitarian support, and the cost of the economic war against Russia, the contribution of Germany and the rest of the EU to Ukraine has been huge.	1657798469396971521

@twittysh1tty @Szymonide @Lavende95298651 @Sim_Programer @TheWarMonitor Where do I have written that? I condemn the war in Iraq exactly like the war in Ukraine.  Or do you think because of a war 2 decades ago we should close our eyes and let Russia do their atrocities after Georgia, Syria, Ukraine? Belarus and Moldova are next in line.	1657798458802044928
@delhi_dave a lost cause ..Russia will take it all if that's the case
